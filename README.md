# Welcome your repository

This repository serves as a private space for 1:1 notes, document goals and growth milestones, or anything else worth sharing between you and your manager.

Out of the box, the [1:1 action](./.github/workflows/1:1.yml) creates a new issue every Monday using the [1:1 issue template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/1:1.md).

## Configuration checklist
- [ ] Be sure to create this repository as a private repository, preferably in your organization account so it's not tied to any one specific manager.
- [ ] Update [the assignees value](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/1:1.md#L6) to include IC and manager usernames
- [ ] Change [cron time](./.github/workflows/1:1.yml#L4) if you'd prefer a different day/time for the 1:1 action to run
- [ ] Invite IC as collaborator
